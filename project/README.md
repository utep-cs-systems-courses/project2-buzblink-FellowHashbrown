# Project 2 - Buzblink

Project 2 consisted of creating a buzzy blinky toy that made sounds and made the lights flash or do something fancy.

## How It Works

* When you press SW1, *Fur Elise* starts playing. It isn't the whole thing, but it's the primary portion of it.
  * Along with that, the red led flashes while in this state

* When you press SW2, the notes in the C scale are played and the green led flashes

* When you press SW3, the notes in the C scale are played, but backwards and both leds flash

* When you press SW4, it stops all sounds and turns the leds off
