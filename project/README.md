# Project 2 - Buzblink

Project 2 consisted of creating a buzzy blinky toy that made sounds and made the lights flash or do something fancy.

## How It Works

* When you press SW1, *Fur Elise* starts playing. It isn't the whole thing, but it's the primary portion of it.
  * Both the green and red LEDs are dimmed to 75% in this state as well

* When you press SW2, *In The Hill of The Mountain King* is played.
  * Both the green and red LEDs are dimmed to 50% in this state as well

* When you press SW3, *Never Gonna Give You Up* by Rick Astley is played but
  just the meme part:
  * *Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around
  and desert you*
  * Both the green and red LEDs are dimmed to 25% in this state as well

* When you press SW4, all sounds stop playing and the LEDs move into a pattern
  of going through the binary numbers from 0 to 3.
  * In state 0, both LEDs are off
  * In state 1, the green LED is on
  * In state 2, the red LED is on
  * In state 3, both LEDs are on
